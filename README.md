# beanandbrew-
A practice programming project written in C# I made during college time

Bean & Brew was a practice scenario I worked on to improve my C# coding abilities, with the prompt centering around creating a website for a cafe to provide more services to it's customers located across Leeds, Harrogate and Knaresborough. I chose to present this through a basic login screen, a pre-order window allowing users to select different products and quantities and eventually log this in an SQL database, and a table booking screen, enabling users to choose one of three cafes and reserve a table virtually. All accounts, orders and bookings were tracked through using MySQL to save all entries to databases.
In the booking window there is another button that would take the user to a page for staff to view upcoming (or past) bookings, by selecting a date range on a calendar and a location. With this data the program uses the previously mentioned SQL database to retrieve the filtered bookings and display them in a table.

I did all this through C#, specifically with the aid of WPF applications, and SQL to implement a back-end
